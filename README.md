#  Cardiovascular Disease Analysis & Prediction

This project is a **healthcare data analytics study** aimed at understanding and predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) using Python-based data exploration, statistical analysis, machine learning, and dashboarding techniques.

Using a real-world dataset of patient health records, this project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual storytelling, and logistic regression modeling to uncover key risk factors and support early detection of heart disease.

##  Project Objectives

- Perform **data cleaning and inspection**, including detection and treatment of missing values and duplicates.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to study variables such as age, gender, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, exercise-induced angina, and thalassemia.
- Use visualizations (count plots, pair plots, heatmaps) to uncover relationships between patient features and CVD occurrence.
- Build a **baseline predictive model** using Logistic Regression to classify patients as healthy or at risk.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Create a **Tableau dashboard** to provide interactive and intuitive insights about the diseased vs. healthy population.
